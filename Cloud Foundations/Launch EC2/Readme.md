# Lab: Launching an EC2 Instance

## Overview
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. This lab shows an overview of launching, resizing, managing, and monitoring an Amazon EC2 instance.

Amazon EC2 makes it easy to set up and manage the computing power  needed with very little friction. It gives full control over resources, all running on Amazon’s reliable infrastructure. It cuts the time it takes to launch new server instances down to just a few minutes, which makes scaling up or down simple as your requirements change.

Amazon EC2 shifts the way  computing costs are handled by letting customers pay only for the capacity they actually use. It also gives developers the tools they need to build applications that can handle failures and stay isolated from common issues, making systems more resilient overall.
