# My AWS ReStart learning Journey

Hello, My name is Unathi Tshoni, an academic trying to pursure a career in Cloud Computing. 

The AWS ReStart learning path introduced me to the core building blocks of cloud computing and how AWS brings them together to create secure, scalable, and cost-effective solutions. I have gained a strong foundation in how the cloud operates and how the different AWS services interact and fit together. 

So far in this course I have explored the core principles of cloud computing and the shared resposibility model. I have also worked hands-on with several fundamental AWS services, in the process; learned how to launch and manage EC2 instances, store and protect data in S3, design secure networks with VPCs and understand the difference between relational and nonrelational databases amongs other things. Understanding IAM has helped me appreciate how access management, identity and security best practices keep cloud environments safe. 

Beyond these technical skills, I also gained insights into pricing models, monitoring tools and cost management. This included learning how to track with CloudWatch, audit with ClouTrail and pay-as-you-go model to reduce spending. Overall, this learning path, has given me a strong starting point in cloud computing; helping me building confidence and develop problem solving skills for an AWS ecosystem.

This repository documents my learning in AWS, focusing on Compute, Storage, Networking, Security, Security, Databases, Automation, Architechture and ML/AI to build scalable, secure and intelligent systems.
